The atmosphere full of stars, planets, clouds and fog emerges from huge colorful streams, forming balls and bubbles. Their surfaces reflect the background pattern, giving the objects  quite a three-dimensional look and feel. The space expands more and more into the depth, until upcoming star bursts make the whole system collapse. The illusion decomposes to a dark splash of substances and disappears as fast as it came up.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe areas you can see in this short film are only a few square centimeters in size, often less than a coin. The streams and interactions of fluids are not visible to the naked eye and have to be caught with a 1:1 macro lens and some very bright led lights.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nIt took me about 70 hours of shooting, trying and failing until I was able to capture pictures with an organic, non-generated character, establishing a truly reliable cosmos. The footage has only been edited, speedramped and color corrected, no composing or CGI. I hope you enjoy it. <br \/>\r\nThis video is entirely shot in 4K and then downscaled or cropped.

We're breaking that concept,\" says Ramos. -Chris Heller (Senior Associate Editor, The Atlantic Video)<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThis is the first episode of RHYTHM IN MOTION, a series of short films about New York's subway musicians.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nwww.RhythmInMotion.nyc<br \/>\r\nhttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/RhythmInMotionNYC <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nFlor de Toloache just released their new album: https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/album\/mariachi-flor-de-toloache\/id956080850<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n...<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nABOUT THE SERIES<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nDirected, produced, shot, and edited by Jenny Schweitzer<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe films were created in collaboration with the MTA\u2019s arts division, MTA Arts & Design, and in association with Killer Content (Still Alice, Alec Baldwin\u2019s Here\u2019s the Thing podcast) and Cinelan (FOCUS FORWARD Short Films, Big Ideas and WE THE ECONOMY 20 Short Films You Can\u2019t Afford To Miss).<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n...<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nNew York City subway buskers are a well-documented bunch.   It is not unusual to witness a sea of iphones capturing those random performances as we scurry to our trains.  Since arriving in NYC in the late-90\u2019s, I, too, have marveled at them, mesmerized by this inimitable cast of characters. All the time, I have wondered what drove these performers underground.  For me, these musicians serve as an essential thread woven into the great culture that forms our vibrant city.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nIt was difficult to develop the first pieces. Having been approached by filmmakers on so many occasions, the musicians initially were skeptical of me. My objective in making these films was to give these gifted people the opportunity to reveal a hidden aspect of who they are and to voice their artistic message.   While the musicians' talent and performances serve as the framework for each film, for me, the allure lies beneath the music.  The films peek into their arresting and deeply personal stories.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nIn 1987 the Metropolitan Transit Authority created Music Under New York to offer musicians access to coveted, high traffic spots in the subway system and to assure the commuters a high level of artistic accomplishment.  An annual, highly selective public audition in Grand Central Station invites newcomers to the roster.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nMore than 350 individual performers participate in more than 7,500 performances throughout the transit system annually.    Rhythm in Motion profiles ten members from the Music Under New York roster.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nFor me, collaborating with Music Under New York was a critical step in moving forward with the project.  It was deeply important that this vital organization value what my films could reveal about their network of musicians and this slice of NYC culture.  -Jenny Schweitzer","url":"http:\/\/vimeo.com\/121802982","upload_date":"2015-03-10 12:56:39","mobile_url":"http:\/\/vimeo.com\/121802982","thumbnail_small":"http:\/\/i.vimeocdn.com\/video\/514280677_100x75.webp","thumbnail_medium":"http:\/\/i.vimeocdn.com\/video\/514280677_200x150.webp","thumbnail_large":"http:\/\/i.vimeocdn.com\/video\/514280677_640.webp","user_id":3585257,"user_name":"Jenny Schweitzer","user_url":"http:\/\/vimeo.com\/jennyschweitzer","user_portrait_small":"http:\/\/i.vimeocdn.com\/portrait\/9253530_30x30.webp","user_portrait_medium":"http:\/\/i.vimeocdn.com\/portrait\/9253530_75x75.webp","user_portrait_large":"http:\/\/i.vimeocdn.com\/portrait\/9253530_100x100.webp","user_portrait_huge":"http:\/\/i.vimeocdn.com\/portrait\/9253530_300x300.webp","stats_number_of_likes":110,"stats_number_of_plays":8687,"stats_number_of_comments":6,"duration":206,"width":1920,"height":1080,"tags":"mariachi, Rhythm in Motion, Jenny Schweitzer, Flor de Toloache, NYC, subway, New York City","embed_privacy":"anywhere"},{"id":126783354,"title":"Red Bull - Melodies for the Lemurs (Full Length)","description":"I was honored with a quite sweet award from the European skateboard community, the 'best film-maker of 2014'.
